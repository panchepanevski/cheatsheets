# GIT

Git, which is a distributed version control system, also provides mechanisms to revert changes, create branches of code, solve merge conflicts, and so on. Those are very useful features that solve specific and common problems that every software team faces every day. And Git is the dominant solution nowadays.

GitHub, on the other hand, is an added layer on top of Git that provides solutions to other specific and common problems such as code reviews, pull requests, issue management/bug tracking, and so on.
